Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
Java Development Kit is program development environment for writing Java Applets and Applications. It consists of a runtime
environment that "sits on top" of the operating system layer as well as the tools and programming that developers need to compile,
debug, and run applets and applications written in the Java language.

What is IDE?
IDE is a software application which enables users to more easily write and debug.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
IDE available free to support Java are NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, Android Studio,BlueJ,jEdit,jGRASP,JSource,JDeveloper
and DrJava. the better IDE among them is IntelliJ.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
a source code using either notepad or eclipse IDE, it needs to be converted into byte code using javac compiler.
Byte code is in the form of .class .  The class file then loads into the JVM using java loader . The JVM then send
all the information to the operating system which shows you the output.

what is class?
A class is a blueprint or a template for creating different objects which defines its properties and behaviors.

What is object?
An object in a class have states and behaviors.

What is the entry point of an application?
an entry point is where control is transferred from the operating system to a computer program, at which place
the processor enters a program or a code fragment and execution begins.

Why main is static?
This is neccesary because main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made. Since it is static it can be directly
invoked via the class. Similarly, we use static sometime for user defined methods so that we need not to make objects.
void indicates that the main() method being declared does not return a value.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
in interface we can declare only some methodes but not able to initiate, however in abstract class we can intiate methods
but it should contain one are more Abtract mehtods.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
we can declare Objects in interface and abstract obects but cannot initiate them in their clasess, thats why we use concreate class.

what is Access Specifier?
The access to classes, constructors, methods and fields, i.e Public,Private, Protected

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define
not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data
structure.
Features of OOP in JAVA
Encapsulation: is a mechanism of wrapping the data like data hiding.
Inheritance: classes can be derived from other classes. it has single level,multi level and hirical inheritance.
Polymorphism: is the ability of an object to take/act/called on many forms.
Abstraction: is used to hide certain details and only show the essential features of the object.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
application programming interface (API) is a list of all classes that are part of the Java development kit (JDK).

Does java support multiple inheritance?
yes it does.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
The code which is prone to exceptions is placed in the try block. When an exception occurs, that exception occurred is
handled by catch block associated.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
he static keyword in Java means that the variable or function is shared between all instances of that class as it
belongs to the type, not the actual objects themselves.

How it has been used in variables and methods ?
static vaiables are belong to the class not top the object or instances.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
In Java we use final keyword to variables to make its values not to be changed.
A final method cannot be overridden or hidden by subclasses. This is used to prevent unexpected behavior from a subclass
altering
What is final, finally and finalize?
Final is used for varibales and methoeds for not to change by sublcasses, finally is used to handle the exception and
finalize to terminate the object.

What is a constructor ?
A constructor is an instance method that usually has the same name as the class, and can be used to set the values of the
members of an object, either to default or to user-defined values.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
Keyword 'THIS' in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object. It can be used to refer current class
instance variable. It can be used to invoke or initiate current class constructor. It can be passed as an argument in
the method call.

What is "super" keyword in java?
It is used inside a sub-class method definition to call a method defined in the super class
What is JVM stand for ?
A Java virtual machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program.

What version of java are you using?
8.0.1440.1

What is JAR stand for ?
A JAR (Java ARchive) is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata
and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution. JAR files are archive files that include a
Java-specific manifest file.

What is compile time and run time?
The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become and executable program. This compilation process
is referred to as compile time. A compiled program can be opened and run by a user. When an application is running, it
is called runtime.

What is heap?
The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease
in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage collection
objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String are a sequence of characters. In the Java programming language, strings are objects.
StringBuffer is very good with mutable String but it has one disadvantage all its public methods are synchronized which
makes it thread-safe but same time slow. In JDK 5 they provided a similar class called StringBuilder in Java which is a
copy of StringBuffer but without synchronization.

What is Singleton class?
Java Singleton Class Example Using Private Constructor. We can make constructor as private. So that We can not create
an object outside of the class. ... Singleton pattern helps us to keep only one instance of a class at any time. The
purpose of singleton is to control object creation by keeping private constructor.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database
or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Integer

Why is String Immutable in Java?
tring not immutable, a connection or file would be changed and lead to serious security threat. Mutable strings could
cause security problem in Reflection too, as the parameters are strings. Efficiency The hashcode of string is frequently
used in Java. For example, in a HashMap

What is constructor chaining in Java?
Calling one constructor from other is called Constructor chaining in Java.

**The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?

What is JIT stands for?
just in time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
whenever we create an object using new operator or by any another means the object is allocated memory from Heap and
When object dies or garbage collected,

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
by using Finallize method.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local variables and function call while
heap memory is used to store objects in Java
